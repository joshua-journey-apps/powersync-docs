Add the [PowerSync Node NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/node) to your project:

<CodeGroup>

```shell npm
npm install @powersync/node
```

```shell yarn
yarn add @powersync/node
```

```shell pnpm
pnpm add @powersync/node
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If you are using `@powersync/node@0.1.1` or earlier, you also need to install `@powersync/better-sqlite3` as a peer dependency.
</Note>

**Common installation issues**

The `@powersync/better-sqlite` package requires native compilation, which depends on certain system tools. This compilation process is handled by `node-gyp` and may fail if required dependencies are missing or misconfigured.

Refer to the [PowerSync Node package README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@powersync/node) for more details.
